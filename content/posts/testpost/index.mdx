Procedural vs OOPS ft. Suits

Here's my effort of bringing up the concept of Traditional Procedural Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming in the form of a story.

There were 2 associates - Harvey and Louis( Yes, I have been watching Suits these days :P)

And Jessica, their managing partner, gave them the following problem to solve-

There are 2 kinds of Associates in the Firm - 
FirstYearAssociates and SecondYearAssociates

Both of them have the following functions to perform -

- minor research 
- prepare documents
Jessica asked Harvey and Louis to solve this problem in an efficient way, and the solution that's most efficient and scalable will be sent over to the client.

Now, Louis decided to go on with the Procedural programming approach, and Harvey insisted on following the Object-Oriented programming.

Louis divided the work to be done in the form of procedures/functions. He created two functions - minorResearch() and prepareDocuments() and wrote the following code for the problem-

void minorResearch(string associate) {
  //
  //

}

void prepareDocuments(string associate) {
  //
  //

}
Now, Harvey wanted to come up with something that would solve the problem in an efficient and scalable way.

He was aware that OOPs is best whenever we need to code real-life situations, so he created two classes - FirstYearAssociates and SecondYearAssociates and defined functions for both of them.

class FirstYearAssociates {
  void research() {

    // DO MINOR RESEARCH

  }

  void prepareDocuments() {
    //
    //

  }

}

class SecondYearAssociates {
  void research() {

    // DO MINOR RESEARCH

  }

  void prepareDocuments() {
    //
    //

  }

}
Both of them went to Jessica and pitched their solutions. Louis pointed out that he solved the problem faster and with fewer lines of code. However, Harvey justified that his approach is scalable and can handle future problems as well.

So Jessica came up with the updated problem statement

The firm now has ThirdYearAssociates as well,
 and they perform the following functions -

- major research 
- prepare documents
- assist Senior Associates

Now, Louis got tensed and thought he was going to lose. He had to make changes in his existing code, which made it quite messy, but he was eventually able to come up with the following solution-


void research(string associate) {

  if associate == "FirstYearAssociate" || associate == "SecondYearAssociate":
    // do minor research

    if associate == "ThirdYearAssociate":
    // do major research

}

void prepareDocuments() {
  //
  //

}

void assistSeniorAssociates() {

  //
  //

}
While all Harvey did, was just adding one more class for Third Year Associates-

import SpotifyPlayer from "./SpotifyPlayer";

Here will a React component go:

<SpotifyPlayer
  uri="spotify:user:bbcamerica:playlist:3w18u69NplCpXVG4fQG726"
  size="large"
  theme="black"
  view="list"
/>

Here will a live code example go:

```js react-live
const onClick = () => {
  alert("You opened me");
};
render(<button onClick={onClick}>Alohomora!</button>);
```

Here will a normal code block go:

```js
(function() {

var cache = {};
var form = $('form');
var minified = true;

var dependencies = {};

var treeURL = 'https://api.github.com/repos/PrismJS/prism/git/trees/gh-pages?recursive=1';
var treePromise = new Promise(function(resolve) {
	$u.xhr({
		url: treeURL,
		callback: function(xhr) {
			if (xhr.status < 400) {
				resolve(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText).tree);
			}
		}
	});
});
```

A code block with a JSDoc comment, short, and long comment:

```js
/**
 * Get value out of string (e.g. rem => px)
 * If value is px strip the px part
 * If the input is already a number only return that value
 * @param {string | number} input
 * @param {number} [rootFontSize]
 * @return {number} Number without last three characters
 * @example removeLastThree('6rem') => 6
 */
const getValue = (input, rootFontSize = 16) => {
  if (typeof input === `number`) {
    return input / rootFontSize;
  }

  const isPxValue = input.slice(-2) === `px`;

  if (isPxValue) {
    return parseFloat(input.slice(0, -2));
  }

  return parseFloat(input.slice(0, -3));
};

// This is a little helper function
const helper = (a, b) => a + b;

// This is also a little helper function but this time with a really long one-line comment that should show some more details
const morehelper = (a, b) => a * b;

export { getValue, helper, morehelper };
```

Normal block without language:

```
import Test from "../components/test"

const Layout = ({ children }) => (
  <Test>
    {children}
  </Test>
)

export default Layout
```

Code block with code highlighting:

```jsx:title=src/components/post.jsx {5-7,10}
import * as React from "react";

const Post = ({ data: { post } }) => (
  <Layout>
    <Heading variant="h2" as="h2">
      {post.title}
    </Heading>
    <p
      sx={{
        color: `secondary`,
        mt: 3,
        a: { color: `secondary` },
        fontSize: [1, 1, 2],
      }}
    >
      <span>{post.date}</span>
      {post.tags && (
        <React.Fragment>
          {` â€” `}
          <ItemTags tags={post.tags} />
        </React.Fragment>
      )}
    </p>
    <section
      sx={{
        ...CodeStyles,
        my: 5,
        ".gatsby-resp-image-wrapper": { my: 5, boxShadow: `lg` },
      }}
    >
      <MDXRenderer>{post.body}</MDXRenderer>
    </section>
  </Layout>
);

export default Post;
```

Code block without title:

```
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
```

Code block without lineNumbers (but lang):

```text noLineNumbers
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
```

Code block without lineNumbers (and without lang):

```noLineNumbers
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
```

Code block with only the title:

```:title=src/utils/scream.js
const scream = (input) => window.alert(input)
```

Code block with only the title but without lineNumbers:

```:title=src/utils/scream.js noLineNumbers
const scream = (input) => window.alert(input)
```

Line highlighting without code title:

```js {2,4-5}
const test = 3;
const foo = "bar";
const harry = "potter";
const hermione = "granger";
const ron = "weasley";
```

Here will `inline code` go, just inside the text. Wow!

Code block without line numbers but with highlighting, language, and title:

```tsx:title=src/components/blog.tsx {7-9,16} noLineNumbers
import * as React from "react";

const Blog = ({ posts }: PostsProps) => {
  const { tagsPath, basePath } = useSiteMetadata();

  return (
    <Layout>
      <Flex sx={{ alignItems: `center`, justifyContent: `space-between` }}>
        <Heading variant="h2" as="h2">
          Blog
        </Heading>
        <Styled.a
          as={Link}
          sx={{ variant: `links.secondary` }}
          to={`/${basePath}/${tagsPath}`.replace(/\/\/+/g, `/`)}
        >
          View all tags
        </Styled.a>
      </Flex>
      <Listing posts={posts} sx={{ mt: [4, 5] }} />
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default Blog;
```
